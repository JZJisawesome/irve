# irve

The Inextensible RISC-V Emulator

"Working our way up to stuff!"

IRVE is intended as a "quick and dirty" emulator capable of running the Linux kernel.

The plan is to use it to better understand the RISC-V architecture (Volume 2 in particular).

Once we do, we can move on to a hardware implementation in SystemVerilog!

Then later on we plan to continue XRVE which will be a much more extensible and powerful emulator written in Rust.
